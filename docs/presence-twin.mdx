## Mission Statement

The digital twin is a service that represents the current state of a device. It contains two sections:

1. **Reported**: The current state of the device as reported by the device itself.
2. **Desired**: The desired state of the device as set by the user.



// TODO: replace with real payload once the design is finalized
