## Mission Statement

In response to regulatory requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Austrian government implemented occupancy restrictions based on building capacity (measured in employees per square meter). For our facility, this translated to a maximum occupancy of 30 people at any given time.
The Presence Bot was developed to address this compliance requirement through the following objectives:

1. Tracks real-time office occupancy through automated employee presence monitoring
1. Assesses compliance status against regulatory occupancy thresholds
1. Delivers automated notifications to staff regarding occupancy levels and compliance status
1. Maintains synchronization with a physical display device that indicates current occupancy and compliance status through visual indicators (LED-lights, Display)
