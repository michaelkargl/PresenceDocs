## Mission Statement

</CanvasBanner>

During the global Covid19 pandemic the austrian government decreed that, depending on the size of the building, only a certain amount of people are allowed to stay indoors (`n` employees/mÂ²). In essence that meant that at peak times, only 30 people are allowed to be present at any time of day.

The presence bot's primary goals were to:

```plantuml

@startuml

:**Count** the employees present at the office;
:**Interpret** the criticality of that number;
:**Decide** on a communication channel;
:**Publish** a notification message to an intranet public channel;
